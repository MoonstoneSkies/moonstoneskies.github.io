# Attribute Search
Attribute Search is a simple plugin that can be used to track down usage of specific state values or attributes. When you enter something in the search box, it searches everything in the mission for attributes with that string in it, as well as the mission setup script for references to that string. It also marks any matched baseparts with a white dot to indicate where it is. The primary purpose of this plugin is to quickly check how states are wired up to different things.
