This section provides guides and documents features of existing plugins. As a general rule, all of these plugins expect for there to be a folder in workspace named `DebugMission` - the custom mission you're currently working on. You may see errors in output if you try to use these plugins without a mission loaded.

Source code for plugins is also provided in the github repo. New features will be available in source before the plugin rbxms are updated, and you can use rojo to build plugins from source if you want access to them early.
