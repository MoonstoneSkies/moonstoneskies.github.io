# Prop Barrier
The prop barrier plugin can be used to quickly add barriers on top of props you don't want players standing on. When the plugin is open, props with barriers are marked blue and props without barriers are black. Click a prop to toggle it.

Barriers created by prop barrier can be destroyed by explosions. They will also automatically be cleaned up/recreated when the prop barrier plugin is opened/closed.
